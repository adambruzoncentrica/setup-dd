    content: `<p>If you’re in credit when you set up a Direct Debit, we’ll offer you two options: </p><ol class="ol-numbered"><li>Take the credit as a refund cheque</li><li>Deduct your credit from the expected cost of your energy</li></ol><p>Taking a refund cheque means we send you the money you have overpaid. To calculate your monthly payments, we divide the expected cost of your energy by the number of months in your plan.</p><p>The second option means that we use the money you have overpaid to reduce your monthly payments over the next 6-12 months. We deduct the credit from your expected energy cost, then divide this reduced amount by the number of months in your plan. This makes your monthly payments smaller.</p><p>It depends on whether you want the money immediately, or you would like to reduce your payments for the length of your plan. One of the potential downsides of reducing your payments with your credit, is that they may increase next year – as there should be no credit to reduce them next time.</p>`
